# ad-growatt

An AppDaemon App Example for controlling Growatt Inverters via HomeAssistant.

This is a further development of the original code by mjdyson. The following are the main changes:
- Ability to control Grid First and Export Limit
- UI now consists of one Lovelace card
- Improved error handling, eg. handling the lock-out by displaying a message
- Can only handle one inverter, specify Device Serial Number in secrets together with username and password for inverter

# Installation
The steps to set up is:

1. If you have the old Growatt integration installed, remove it, as it might trigger the server block on Growatt servers. For monitoring, use Grott https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott. This step is optional but will improve stability greatly.

2. Install AppDaemon from Add-ons in HA

3. Copy files from ad-growatt on Github to your config directory (/config on my HA Yellow, will use this path going foroward, but it might be different on your installation)

4. Modify /config/configuration.yaml to include
```
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
```

5. Modify /config/secrets to include:
```
growatt_username: X
growatt_password: X
growatt_device: X
```
Replacing Xâ€™s with login, password and Device Serial Number (found on main page of Growatt Server: Login Page https://server.growatt.com/)

6. Restart HA, or just reload HA configuration and restart AppDaemon

7. Create the Lovelace card, see code above

Enjoy controlling your Growatt inverter directly from HA !!


# Example of automation templates for automations.yaml
Automations can set the values on the Lovelace card and then push the button to Get or Save. Eg. the below example calls the script to turn on export limit, but only if the current condition of export limit is off (to avoid too many api calls)
```
- id: 'XX'
  alias: Export Limit On
  description: When something happens, turn off export
  trigger:
    define your own trigger, eg. price from Nordpool
  condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.adgw_export_limit_on
    state: 'off'
  action:
  - service: script.adgw_set_export_limit_on
    data: {}
  mode: single
```
And this example turns off export limit
```
- id: 'XX'
  alias: Export Limit Off
  description: When something happens, turn off export
  trigger:
    define your own trigger, eg. price from Nordpool
  condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.adgw_export_limit_on
    state: 'on'
  action:
  - service: script.adgw_set_export_limit_off
    data: {}
  mode: single
```

# Disclaimer

The developers & maintainers of this library accept no responsibility for any damage, problems or issues that arise with your Growatt systems as a result of its use.

The library contains functions that allow you to modify the configuration of your plant & inverter which carries the ability to set values outside of normal operating parameters, therefore, settings should only be modified if you understand the consequences.

To the best of our knowledge only the settings functions perform modifications to your system and all other operations are read only. Regardless of the operation:

The library is used entirely at your own risk.
